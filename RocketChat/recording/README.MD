This Android Module is just an strip down of repo [AndroidRecording](https://github.com/panzy/AndroidRecording).
Changes:
- Moved project to gradle format;
- Removed unused classes (Activities and resources);
- Forward Exceptions to callbacks when they happen;

Any source inside this module should follow the same license roles as in the "forked"/source repo.
